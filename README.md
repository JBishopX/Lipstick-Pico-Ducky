# Lipstick-Pico-Ducky
This is a writeup of my lipstick pico-ducky project.It is a combination of a pico-ducky project and a covert Raspberry Pi Pico case made from a modified lipstick tube.

In this project, I combined instructions from Network Chuck's video and dbisu's Pico-Ducky project, 
then modified the Ducky Script from Hak5's YouTube Roll to fit my needs.

The covert case was made from a modified lipstick tube.
